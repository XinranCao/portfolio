## Portfolio Website

Inspired by a [portfolio project](https://github.com/ZainRk/Personal-Portfolio-2-starter-pack) by [ZAINKEEPSCODE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu9I33nDeBk).

This is a self-build portfolio website using React, SCSS, Vite, and Framer Motion, among others. The starter code served as a starting point, but I personally constructed its structure and filled it with content. While it is currently a single-page web application, my future plan involves restructuring it using react router."

More projects are coming soon!
